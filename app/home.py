    Motion synthesis is a fast evolving field, with groundbreaking research being published every year. The task is to synthesise humanoid motion from a text prompt. I am implementing such a model, and will demonstrate/explain it here.

    The approach I will be employing, is diffusion on a latent representation. This is a powerful technique demonstrated in the literature. I work with the publicly available HumanML3D dataset, which contains 3D motion capture data with descriptive text strings from KIT.

    My goals in this project we the following:
    * Acquire deep knowledge of the transformer architecture, and diffusion model.
    * Learn how to build a large AI project from scratch. How to manage the codebase, and the project as a whole. And which modern tools to use (e.g. PyTorch Lightning, Tensorboard, Hydra).
    * Implement a model that can generate motion from a text prompt.
